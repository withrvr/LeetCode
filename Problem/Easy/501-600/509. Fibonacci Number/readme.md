# Solution

- [a.py](./a.py)
  - a=-1, b=1
  - takeing initial series (a=0, b=1) back word 1/2 times
  - so that no need or extra conditions
  -
  - then starting the main login
  - since init values or diff now
  - for i=0 ... we will get 0
  - for i=1 ... we will get 1
  - and so on

  - Best Fibonacci Logic ever
  - mysirji idea which i like so much
  - which i have done before :: https://www.sololearn.com/compiler-playground/cH0clF0215wO

- [a.py](./a.py)
  - little complex as compare to a.py
  - to understand ( but runs 1 condition less )
  - returns a .. be care full
  - as for f(0) directly return 0
