- https://leetcode.com/study-plan/binary-search/?progress=x31a8njd

- `Approach 4, Golden-section search`
  - don't know but
  - read something about it
  - its better and faster
  - but new to me
  - so unable to implement
  - / hard for me  ..... as first time

```
use this
int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

not this
int mid = (low + high) / 2;
```

# âœ…: Solution

- a ... linear search
- b ... binary search
- c ... build in max func
-
- __b ... best solution
